## An Overview of Regional Changes in Earth Surface Temperature (1950 - 2013): Policy Recommendations

### Executive Summary 

This report provides (1) a comprehensive overview of regional differences in earth surface temperature change as a result of climate variability, and (2) a preliminary picture of how regional effects on and of climate variables might affect production crop index differentially over time. Policy recommendations focus on addressing food insecurity in low-latitude regions and leveraging the climate feedback mechanisms behind higher crop yield in high-latitude regions to offset reduced crop production in low-latitude regions (e.g. countries in Asia and Africa). It is proposed that high-latitude regions implement a combination of supply-side measures including grazing land management strategies, food diversification efforts, and more efficient transport measures  to reduce greenhouse gas contributions, and thereby offset the impact of lower crop yields in low-latitude regions that (1) experience higher average temperatures than the rest of the world, and (2) do not possess the political or economic infrastructure to alleviate the adverse effects of agricultural changes. 

The following dynamic visualization indicates changes in average temperature by country:
