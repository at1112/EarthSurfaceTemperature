## An Overview of Regional Changes in Earth Surface Temperature (1950 - 2013): Policy Recommendations

### Executive Summary 

This report provides (1) a comprehensive overview of regional differences in earth surface temperature change as a result of climate variability, and (2) a preliminary picture of how regional effects on and of climate variables might affect production crop index differentially over time. Policy recommendations focus on addressing food insecurity in low-latitude regions and leveraging the climate feedback mechanisms behind higher crop yield in high-latitude regions to offset reduced crop production in low-latitude regions (e.g. countries in Asia and Africa). It is proposed that high-latitude regions implement a combination of supply-side measures including grazing land management strategies, food diversification efforts, and more efficient transport measures  to reduce greenhouse gas contributions, and thereby offset the impact of lower crop yields in low-latitude regions that (1) experience higher average temperatures than the rest of the world, and (2) do not possess the political or economic infrastructure to alleviate the adverse effects of agricultural changes. 

The following dynamic visualization indicates changes in average temperature by country:

### Key highlights/stories your visualization can be used to highlight (talking points):

1.	Because it is hard to control for the regional variables discussed above in lower-latitude regions, we suggest production targets that account for regional effects of temperature on crop production. More specifically, this means placing more stringent regulations on countries in the Americas to curb greenhouse gas emissions. 
2.	We suggest the implementation of supply-side practices which reduce livestock emissions through grazing land management . Leveraging the positive effects of temperature increases on food systems in the Americas in order to offset the negative effects of temperature increases on crop production in lower-latitude regions such as Asia and Africa provide an opportunity to use a “food system” approach to offsetting food insecurity as a result of climate change. 
3.	We recommend land-based changes in countries in the Americas to mitigate the negative temperature effects in other regions. This can also be accomplished through diversifying food choice in higher-latitude regions as well, because production systems and individual diets play a large role in greenhouse gas contributions. 
4.	Implementing more efficient production and transport measures in the Americas can potentially offset the impact of lower crop yields in low-latitude regions that do not possess the infrastructure to alleviate the adverse effects of agricultural changes.
